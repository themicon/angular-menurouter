**angular-menurouter** is an AngularJS module that works as a pretty simple module wrapper for uiRouter and ocLazyLoad. It's intended to be used in applications with an organization by components, simplifying the route and menu creation and providing a quick way to handle _lazyloaded_ assets.  

This doesn't pretend to be a definitive implementation, neither a complex code. KISS.
